        Content posted, emailed, transmitted or otherwise made available via the
        Service. You agree that you must evaluate, and bear all risks associated
        with, the use of any Content, including any reliance on the accuracy,
        completeness, or usefulness of such Content. In this regard, you
        acknowledge that you may not rely on any Content created by the Service
        or submitted to the Service. You acknowledge and agree that Manifold may
        preserve Content and may also disclose Content if required to do so by
