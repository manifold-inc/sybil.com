          <p>
            Service providers. We may share personal information with service
            providers that perform certain services on our behalf. For example,

            Analytics service providers. We may share anonymized usage
            information with analytics service providers that assist us in the
            improvement and optimization of our website. For example, Google

      <p>
        We may use third party services, such as Application Programming
        Interfaces (APIs), to maintain and improve our services. For example,
        queries may transmitted to OpenAI API in order to serve requests. No
